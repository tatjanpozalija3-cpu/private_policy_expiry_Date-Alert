  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="meta">
    App name: <strong>Expiry Date: Alert</strong><br />
    Developer: <strong>Tatjan Pozalija</strong><br />
    Contact email: <a href="mailto:tatjanpozalija3@icloud.com">tatjanpozalija3@icloud.com</a><br />
    Effective date: <strong>October 28, 2025</strong>
  </div>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Expiry Date: Alert</strong> handles information when you use the app.
    “We”, “our”, and “us” in this document refer to <strong>Tatjan Pozalija</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>1. What the app does</h2>
  <p>
    Expiry Date: Alert helps you track the expiration dates of your food and receive reminders before something
    goes bad so you can reduce waste and save money.
  </p>

  <h2>2. What data we collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>We do not ask you to create an account and we do not require your name, address, payment details,
    location, or other personal identifiers to use the core features of the app.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>Inside the app you can save:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Item name (for example: “Milk”)</li>
    <li>Expiration / best-before date</li>
    <li>Optional notes you enter yourself</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This information is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> so that the app can show your inventory
    and send expiry reminders.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Device permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The app may request permission to send you push or local notifications about upcoming expiration dates.
    You can enable or disable notifications at any time in your device settings.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app does not access your contacts, photos, precise location, microphone, or camera unless a future
    version clearly asks you first and you explicitly allow it.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Do we send your data to our servers</h2>
  <p>
    At this time, we do <strong>not</strong> transmit your food list or expiry dates to our own servers or to
    third-party analytics providers. Your data stays on your device.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only time we may receive information from you is if you choose to contact us by email for support.
    In that case we will receive whatever you send us (for example screenshots, description of an issue,
    device model). We will only use that information to help you and improve the app.
  </p>

  <h2>5. How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To show you your items, dates, and reminders inside the app</li>
    <li>To send notifications before products expire (if you allow notifications)</li>
    <li>To respond to support requests if you email us</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    Your in-app data (products and dates) is stored on your device until you delete it yourself or uninstall
    the app. We do not automatically receive a copy.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you contact us by email, we may keep the conversation for a reasonable period in order to provide
    ongoing support and to maintain records of bugs or feature requests. You can ask us to delete past
    support emails at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data sharing and selling</h2>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> share your personal information with advertisers or data brokers.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may disclose limited information if required to do so by law or to protect our rights,
    property, or safety.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have rights under privacy and data protection laws
    (for example GDPR in the EU or state privacy laws in the US). These rights can include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Right to access: You can ask what personal data we have about you</li>
    <li>Right to correct: You can ask us to fix inaccurate information</li>
    <li>Right to delete: You can ask us to delete personal data we hold about you</li>
    <li>Right to object or limit certain uses</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Since the app does not collect or upload your fridge data to our servers, most of the data is already
    fully in your control on your device. If you emailed us and want that data removed, contact us at
    <a href="mailto:tatjanpozalija3@icloud.com">tatjanpozalija3@icloud.com</a> and we will help.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Expiry Date: Alert is not directed to children under 13 and is not designed to collect personal
    information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has
    provided personal information to us without your consent, please email us and we will delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable steps to protect information you choose to share with us (for example through
    support email). However, please remember that no method of electronic communication or storage
    can be guaranteed 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>11. International users</h2>
  <p>
    If you contact us from outside your country, please be aware that email communication can be
    processed in other regions in order for us to respond. By emailing us you understand this.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the app’s features, legal requirements,
    or our practices. If we make material changes, we will update the “Effective date” at the top of
    this page. We recommend reviewing this page from time to time.
  </p>

  <h2>13. Contact us</h2>

    If you have any questions about privacy or data use in Expiry Date: Alert, or if you want to
